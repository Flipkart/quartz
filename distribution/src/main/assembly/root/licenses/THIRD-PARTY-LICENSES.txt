Acknowledgements & Disclosures

Terracotta gratefully acknowledges the open-source software community's
contributions to the development of our products.  In accordance with
requirements established by the operative license agreements entered
into by Terracotta and certain third-party software vendors, Terracotta 
discloses the items listed below.

In addition, please note that any customer that purchases and installs
Terracotta software accepts, and agrees to comply with, the license
agreements cited herein.  Terracotta does not charge any customer for
the use of any third-party software product(s).

Disclosures:

(1) Terracotta's software uses unmodified portions of ANTLR's source
code and uses its output.

(2) Terracotta incorporates ObjectWeb's ASM into its software, and
recites the following terms, pursuant to the governing BSD license.
(Note that herein, "copyright holder" and "contributor" refers to
ObjectWeb, and "software" refers to the ASM product.)

Copyright (c) 2005, ObjectWeb (ASM).  All rights reserved.

Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without

met:

(1) Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright

(2) Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above
copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer
in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the
distribution.

(3) Neither the name of ObjectWeb (ASM) nor the names of its
contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from
this software without specific prior written permission.

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS

TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT
OWNER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE,
DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY
THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE
OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

(4) Terracotta incorporates AspectWerkz into its software.
 Because Terracotta does not modify Aspectwerkz and redistribute the
modifications, most of the substantive terms of the governing Lesser
GNU Public License (LGPL) are inapplicable, pursuant to the express
terms of the Aspectwerkz licensing documentation, which is available
online at http://aspectwerkz.codehaus.org/license.html and excerpted in
relevant part, below:  AspectWerkz is Free Software. The LGPL license
is sufficiently flexible to allow the use of AspectWerkz in both open
source and commercial projects. Using AspectWerkz (by importing
AspectWerkz's public interfaces in your Java code), and extending
AspectWerkz (by subclassing) is considered by the authors of
AspectWerkz to be dynamic linking. Hence our interpretation of the LGPL
is that the use of the unmodified AspectWerkz source does not affect
the license of your application code. The use of the unmodified
AspectWerkz binary of course never affects the license of your
application or distribution. If you modify AspectWerkz and redistribute
your modifications, the LGPL applies.

(5) Terracotta incorporates eleven components into its software
(Apache Commons CLI; Apache Commons Collections; Apache Commons IO,
Apache Commons Lang; Apache Commons Logging; Apache Jakarta Regexp;
Apache Log4j; Apache Xalan-Java; Apache XMLBeans 2.0.0; TrueZIP; 
Google Collections; and Jetty) that are licensed under the Apache
